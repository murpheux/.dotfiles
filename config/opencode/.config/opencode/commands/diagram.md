Create an architecture diagram for: $ARGUMENTS

1. Load the `architecture-diagrams` skill and choose the format (use draw.io via the `drawio-diagrams` skill if I asked for draw.io/diagrams.net or vendor icons with manual layout; Mermaid if it lives in Markdown).
2. Derive components and flows from the repository (IaC, compose/stack files, k8s manifests, code) or from my description — don't invent components; list assumptions.
3. Save the source under `docs/diagrams/` (kebab-case), validate it, render SVG (and PNG if useful), and return the paths plus a short legend.
